ðŸŒŸ From Chemistry to Cybersecurity: My Career Journey ðŸŒŸ

Having started my academic journey with an undergraduate background in Chemistry, I always knew my path would lead me to explore various fields. 
My passion for technology drove me to pursue a career in tech, and that led me to take a course in Product Management. 
After gaining some valuable experience, I landed a role as an IAM Officer, which sparked my deep interest in cybersecurity. 
The knowledge that attackers are constantly devising new ways to breach systems is what motivates me every day to continue learning and expanding my skillset.

To build a strong foundation in cybersecurity, I took the initiative to earn several certifications:

Certified in Cybersecurity by ISC2
COBIT 2019 Foundation
CompTIA Security+
AWS Foundational Course

Currently, I am furthering my expertise by pursuing a Diploma in Cybersecurity at ALTSCHOOL Africa, where I am immersing myself in the latest trends and continually enhancing my technical skills to stay ahead in this dynamic industry.

As I continue to grow in this field, Iâ€™m looking to connect with cybersecurity professionals and enthusiasts. 
If youâ€™re in the industry or have insights to share, Iâ€™d love to hear from you. 
Letâ€™s exchange ideas and support each other as we navigate this ever-evolving landscape. Feel free to connect!
